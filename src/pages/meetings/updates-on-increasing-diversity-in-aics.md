templateKey: meeting
title: Updates on increasing diversity in AICS
date: 2020-07-27T19:34:42.907Z
project: Another Project
agenda: >-
  We’re taking advantage of the EMT meeting being cancelled to give some updates
  about work we’ve been doing in Cell Science around increasing diversity in our
  institute. (We may not use the whole hour and a half.) Goals will be to
  brainstorm around internships, give updates about non-profit education
  organizations we’ve reached out to and establish a more regular meeting
  cadence.


  Please let me know if I should add anyone, or feel free to forward!!
