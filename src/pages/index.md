  * **New idea/question**:  This is an idea for a project or research question
  that someone could use one of our datasets to investigate, but does not have
  any or (has very little) preliminary work done towards this project. 

  * **Early dataset**: A dataset in progress, possibly not fully tested to the standards of our pipeline data, but has interesting features that we want to share. 

  * **Observation**: Something we've seen in our data that may be an interesting jumping off point for a project, or could be corroborating data for a project in another model system. anyone.
